## Overview
Sickle cell crises are unpredictable and can be life-threatening. This project leverages **Python** and **machine learning algorithms** to analyze key health parameters (like temperature, PCV, malaria levels, etc.) and predict the probability of a crisis occurring.

The app is designed for:
- Healthcare providers
- Patients who want to monitor their health
- Data enthusiasts interested in medical AI projects

---

## Features
- Predicts risk of sickle cell crisis based on input health data
- Simple command-line interface for testing predictions
- Easily extendable to GUI or web interface
- Works with CSV input for batch predictions

---

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of patient records including parameters like:
  - Temperature
  - PCV (Packed Cell Volume)
  - Malaria level
  - Typhoid level
  - Patient age and other indicators
- For privacy, synthetic data is used in this demo.
